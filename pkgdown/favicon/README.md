# Favicon directory

To generate favicons for the pkgdown website, run the script in the package root:

```r
source("create_favicons.R")
```

This will use the package logo to create multiple favicon files in different sizes and formats.

The script requires the `pkgdown` package, which can be installed with:

```r
install.packages("pkgdown")
```
