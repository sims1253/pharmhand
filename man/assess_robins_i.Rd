\description{
Assesses the risk of bias for a single non-randomized study using the
ROBINS-I tool. The overall judgment is automatically calculated based on
domain judgments using the following algorithm:
\itemize{
\item "Low": All domains rated "Low"
\item "Moderate": At least one "Moderate" but no "Serious" or "Critical"
\item "Serious": At least one "Serious" but no "Critical"
\item "Critical": Any domain rated "Critical"
\item "No information": At least one "No information" with all others
"Low" or "Moderate"
