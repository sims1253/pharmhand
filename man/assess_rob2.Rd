\value{
A RoB2Result object with the assessment results.

\description{
Assesses the risk of bias for a single study using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.
The overall judgment is automatically calculated based on domain judgments
using the following rules:
\itemize{
\item "Low": All domains rated "Low"
\item "High": Any domain rated "High" OR 2+ domains rated "Some concerns"
\item "Some concerns": All other combinations
}
