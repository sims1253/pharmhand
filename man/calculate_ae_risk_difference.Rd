\title{Calculate Risk Difference and Confidence Interval for AE}
\usage{
calculate_ae_risk_difference(n1, N1, n2, N2, conf_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{n1}{Number of subjects with event in treatment group}

\item{N1}{Total subjects in treatment group}

\item{n2}{Number of subjects with event in reference group}

\item{N2}{Total subjects in reference group}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level (default: 0.95)}
}
\value{
List with rd (risk difference), rd_lower, rd_upper, rr (risk ratio),
rr_lower, rr_upper, p_value
}
\description{
Calculates risk difference, risk ratio, and associated confidence intervals
and p-values for comparing adverse event incidence between two groups.
Uses Wald method for risk difference CI and log-transformation for risk ratio CI.
