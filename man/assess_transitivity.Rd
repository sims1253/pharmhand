\title{Assess Transitivity for Indirect Comparisons}
\usage{
assess_transitivity(
  study_characteristics,
  char_vars,
  treatment_var = "treatment",
  continuous_vars = NULL,
  threshold_smd = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_characteristics}{Data frame with study-level
characteristics. Must include 'study_id' and 'treatment'
columns, plus characteristics to compare.}

\item{char_vars}{Character vector. Names of characteristic
variables to assess.}

\item{treatment_var}{Character. Name of treatment variable.
Default: "treatment"}

\item{continuous_vars}{Character vector. Which char_vars are
continuous (vs categorical)}

\item{threshold_smd}{Numeric. SMD threshold for imbalance.
Default: 0.1}
}
\value{
TransitivityAssessment list with comparison tables and
overall assessment
}
\description{
Evaluates the transitivity assumption by comparing population characteristics
across studies in a network. Transitivity requires that studies are similar
enough that indirect comparisons are valid.
