\arguments{
\item{yi}{Numeric vector of effect estimates}

\item{sei}{Numeric vector of standard errors}

\item{study_labels}{Character vector of study names}

\item{effect_measure}{Character. Effect type: "hr" (hazard ratio),
"or" (odds ratio), "rr" (risk ratio), "rd" (risk difference),
"md" (mean difference), "smd" (standardized mean difference)}

\item{prior_mu}{Prior for overall effect mean (default: 0, very wide)}

informative priors that pull tau towards smaller values}

\item{prior_sensitivity}{Logical. Whether to perform prior
sensitivity analysis}

\item{chains}{Integer. Number of MCMC chains (default: 4)}

\item{iter}{Integer. Total iterations per chain (default: 6000)}

\item{warmup}{Integer. Warmup iterations (default: 3000)}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility}

\item{adapt_delta}{Numeric. MCMC sampler tuning parameter (0-1)}

\item{max_treedepth}{Integer. Maximum tree depth for NUTS sampler}

\item{backend}{Character. Stan backend: "auto", "cmdstanr", "rstan"}

\description{
Specialized Bayesian meta-analysis for situations with few studies (typically
< 5-10 studies). Uses conservative priors and includes sensitivity analysis.
}
\details{
This function is specifically designed for meta-analyses with few studies
and implements several adjustments:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Conservative priors}: Uses more informative priors that are appropriate
when data is sparse
\item \strong{Regularization}: Stronger regularization of between-study variance (tau^2)
\item \strong{Sensitivity analysis}: Includes prior sensitivity analysis by default
\item \strong{Few studies warnings}: Provides explicit warnings about limitations
}

Recommended for meta-analyses with 2-10 studies. For larger meta-analyses,
use the standard bayesian_meta_analysis() function.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Meta-analysis with only 3 studies
yi <- log(c(0.75, 0.82, 0.68))  # log(HR) from 3 studies
sei <- c(0.12, 0.15, 0.18)       # standard errors

result <- bayesian_meta_analysis_few(
  yi = yi,
  sei = sei,
  effect_measure = "hr",
  chains = 2,
  iter = 4000
)

# With prior sensitivity analysis
result <- bayesian_meta_analysis_few(
  yi = yi,
  sei = sei,
  effect_measure = "hr",
  prior_sensitivity = TRUE,
  chains = 2,
  iter = 4000
)
