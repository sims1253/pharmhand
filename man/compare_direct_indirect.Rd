\title{Compare Direct and Indirect Evidence}
\usage{
compare_direct_indirect(
  direct_result,
  indirect_result,
  effect_measure = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{direct_result}{ComparisonResult or list with estimate and se
for direct evidence}

\item{indirect_result}{ComparisonResult from indirect_comparison()}

\item{effect_measure}{Character. Effect type (if not in results)}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric. Confidence level. Default: 0.95}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{direct_estimate}{Direct evidence effect estimate}
\item{indirect_estimate}{Indirect evidence effect estimate}
\item{pooled_estimate}{Inverse-variance weighted pooled estimate}
\item{pooled_ci}{CI for pooled estimate}
\item{inconsistency_p}{P-value for inconsistency test}
\item{effect_measure}{Effect measure used}
\item{is_consistent}{Logical; TRUE if p > 0.05}
}
}
\description{
Compares direct evidence (from head-to-head trials) with indirect evidence
(from anchored comparison) to assess consistency.
}
\examples{
# Compare direct and indirect evidence
# Direct evidence: A vs B from head-to-head trial
direct <- list(estimate = log(0.80), se = 0.15)

# Indirect evidence via Bucher method
indirect <- indirect_comparison(
  effect_ab = log(0.75), se_ab = 0.12,
  effect_bc = log(0.85), se_bc = 0.10,
  effect_measure = "hr"
)

comparison <- compare_direct_indirect(
  direct_result = direct,
  indirect_result = indirect,
  effect_measure = "hr"
)
