A list with components:
\describe{
\item{direct_estimate}{Direct evidence effect estimate}
\item{indirect_estimate}{Indirect evidence effect estimate}
\item{pooled_estimate}{Inverse-variance weighted pooled estimate}
\item{pooled_ci}{CI for pooled estimate}

(from anchored comparison) to assess consistency.
