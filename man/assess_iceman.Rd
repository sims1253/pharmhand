\arguments{
\item{subgroup_result}{Subgroup analysis result (from create_subgroup_table)}

\item{is_prespecified}{Logical. Was the subgroup prespecified?}

\item{hypothesis_direction}{Character. Was direction prespecified?
Options: "correct", "opposite", "none"}

\item{n_subgroups}{Integer. Total number of subgroups analyzed}

\item{biological_rationale}{Character. Strength of biological rationale:
"strong", "moderate", "weak", "none"}

\item{effect_measure}{Character. Consistent with overall effect?
"consistent", "opposite", "uncertain"}

\item{within_study}{Logical. Is this within-study comparison?}

\item{statistical_test}{Character. Type of interaction test used:
"formal", "informal", "none"}

\item{interaction_pvalue}{Numeric. P-value for interaction (if tested)}

\item{replication}{Character. Has finding been replicated?
"yes", "no", "not_applicable"}

\item{other_evidence}{Character. Supporting evidence from other sources:
"strong", "moderate", "weak", "none"}

\value{
ICEMANResult object with criteria assessments and overall credibility
}
\description{
Evaluates the credibility of subgroup analyses using the ICEMAN criteria.
The 10 criteria assess whether an apparent subgroup effect is likely to
be a true effect modification.
