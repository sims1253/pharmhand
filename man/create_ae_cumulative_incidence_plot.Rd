\description{
Creates cumulative incidence plot for adverse events using 1 - KM estimator.
For simple analyses without competing risks.
}
\details{
Uses 1 - Kaplan-Meier to estimate cumulative incidence. This is appropriate
when there are no competing risks or competing risks are minimal.

If \code{event_var} contains values other than 0/1, they are treated as competing
events and coded as censored for this estimator.

For analyses with significant competing risks (e.g., mortality), consider
using dedicated competing risk packages like cmprsk.
