\title{Test for Inconsistency Using Node-Splitting}
\usage{
node_splitting(nma_result, data = NULL, conf_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{nma_result}{Result from network_meta()}

\item{data}{Original NMA data frame}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric. Confidence level. Default: 0.95}
}
\value{
Data frame with direct, indirect, and inconsistency test results
}
\description{
Separates direct and indirect evidence for each comparison and tests
for inconsistency between them.
}
\note{
This is a simplified implementation. Full node-splitting requires
re-running the network meta-analysis excluding direct evidence for each
comparison, which is computationally intensive. Consider using specialized
NMA packages (e.g., gemtc, netmeta) for rigorous inconsistency assessment.
