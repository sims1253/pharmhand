  mean1,
  sd1,
  n1,
  mean2,
  sd2,
  n2,
  method = c("cohens_d", "hedges_g"),

}
\arguments{
\item{mean1}{Numeric. Mean of group 1 (treatment group).}

\item{sd1}{Numeric. Standard deviation of group 1. Must be positive.}

\item{n1}{Integer. Sample size of group 1. Must be >= 2.}

\item{mean2}{Numeric. Mean of group 2 (control/reference group).}

\item{sd2}{Numeric. Standard deviation of group 2. Must be positive.}

\item{n2}{Integer. Sample size of group 2. Must be >= 2.}

\item{method}{Character. Method for calculating SMD. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cohens_d"} (default): Uses pooled standard deviation
\item \code{"hedges_g"}: Applies small-sample bias correction to Cohen's d
}}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric. Confidence level for CI calculation (default: 0.95).}
}
\value{
A named list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{smd}: The standardized mean difference
\item \code{ci_lower}: Lower bound of confidence interval
\item \code{ci_upper}: Upper bound of confidence interval
\item \code{method}: Method used ("cohens_d" or "hedges_g")
\item \code{se}: Standard error of the SMD
}
}
\description{
Calculates the standardized mean difference (SMD) between two groups for
continuous variables using either Cohen's d or Hedges' g. SMD is a key
metric for assessing baseline balance in randomized controlled trials,
particularly important for GBA/AMNOG dossier submissions.
}
\details{
\strong{Cohen's d} is calculated as:
\deqn{d = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_{pooled}}}

where \eqn{s_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}}

\strong{Hedges' g} applies a correction factor for small samples:
\deqn{g = d \times \left(1 - \frac{3}{4(n_1+n_2)-9}\right)}

The 95\% confidence interval is calculated using the large-sample variance:
\deqn{Var(d) = \frac{n_1+n_2}{n_1 n_2} + \frac{d^2}{2(n_1+n_2)}}
}
\examples{
# Cohen's d for age between treatment groups

  mean1 = 55.2, sd1 = 12.3, n1 = 150,
  mean2 = 53.8, sd2 = 11.9, n2 = 148
)

# Hedges' g with small sample correction
calculate_smd(
  mean1 = 55.2, sd1 = 12.3, n1 = 25,
  mean2 = 53.8, sd2 = 11.9, n2 = 23,
  method = "hedges_g"
